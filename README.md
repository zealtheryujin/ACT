# ACT
A chart converter for rhythm games. This tool is converting .osz files (Osu! file type) to basic .json charts, so you can use it easily on your rhythm game.

# How to use?
Place the .osz file of the song you want in the input folder. If you dont know how to create an .osz file, use the Mug-Diffusion

Then, just run the .bat file. Your chart's will be created at output file.

Don't forget the install requirements.

Also this converter will give u 2 .json files, 4K and 6K. 4K is for 4 highway mod and 6K is for 6 highway mod, so its actually modded for basic rthym games logic (Guitar Hero etc.). If u are planning develop a more complex game u need mod the logic of tool for yourself.
